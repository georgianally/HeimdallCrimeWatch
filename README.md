# HeimdallCrimeWatch
Crime watch app using UK Police and Google Maps API

Users can give their current location, using the phoneâ€™s built in GPS, and see crimes around them within a one-mile radius. Users are also able to input a postcode to view a different area. 

These crimes are displayed on both a map and list view, and when selected will take users to a page displaying more details on the crime.

A user can choose a location, then filter their crime search by type.

Users can also save locations to have quick access to.
